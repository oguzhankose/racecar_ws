Carrot planner ? (Always finds a goal) (As global planner)

  - Neutral Cost
  - Lethal Cost
  - Cost Factor

Two circle footprint

Cost scaling factor for decreasing the slope of infilation
For going from center of obstacles

Decrease cost scaling

Low costmap resolution may cause obstacle layer overlap

Costmap resolution due to laser resolution

Or unknown dots will appear

Can be 2 times of lidar resolution

Create map frame

Tf odom frame wrt imu data and map frame

Obstacle layer has 2 dimensions
Voxel layer has 3 dimensions

Voxel == 3D volumetric cube

AMCL without location ?

AMCL parameters for RPLidar

Increasing lidar frequency

How to detect that robot is stuck?

Basic state machine that will recover robot from stuck situation

At least dont blow up the planning

Very very very usefull source for robot navigation in ros

Verfy speed profile

Sensörleri fuse etme

Laser scan e çevir ikisini de

Lidar verisi varsa o şekil bırak

Veri olmayan açıları zed den alarak ekle

Voxelle çözünürlüğü düşür

Yolla gitsin

Zed i lidar frame ine tf le

Veri olan yerde başka ne yapılabilir ?

Add heading as reference

So you can check the performance
